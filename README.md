# Amazfit GTR 4 Mini - Poketch
I don't know what I'm doing yet. But I'm dumping everything here first.

## Why are you making this?
Because I've had a Poketch watchface for every smartwatch I've ever owned so far and I'm not stopping now.
- Pebble Time Steel/Round (RIP)
- Bangle.js 2 - [found here](https://github.com/elykittytee/BangleApps/tree/master/apps/pokeclk)

## What device(s) will this work on?
The Amazfit GTR 4 Mini

## How do I install?
No idea yet.
